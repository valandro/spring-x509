# spring-x509

In cryptography, `X.509` is a standard defining the format of **public key certificates**. X.509 certificates are used 
in many Internet protocols, including `TLS/SSL`, which is the basis for `HTTPS`, the secure protocol for browsing 
the web. An X.509 certificate contains **a public key** and an **identity** (a hostname, or an organization, 
or an individual), and is either **signed by a certificate authority** or **self-signed**.
